# Group 23 - Analyzing the Five Factor Personality Test

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Why is this dataset interesting?


Our interests in the data relate to associations between the broad traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) as well as inter-item correlations and relations between demographic information and personality traits. We are interested in how personality traits, individual items, and demographic information are related and can be used to predict outcomes. For instance, are extraversion and openness positively correlated? Is gender a predictor of personality traits? Additionally, we will combine the individual items in the dataset to create a ‘total’ score for each individual on each trait. In general, we are interested in psychology and personality theory and are hoping to reveal relationships among the variables in the dataset as well as our created ‘total’ variables. Some potential avenues for our research include: comparing the associations among the broad traits, comparing associations between broad traits and their constituent items, associations between scores on the broad traits and demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race). 



## What is the dataset?


Our dataset consists of responses to the 5-factor personality test (AKA Big 5 personality test). The 5-Factor Personality test was developed in the 1980s after factor analysis revealed certain words/phrases used to describe personality tend to 'hang together' (i.e., there are 5 personality factors) and can be grouped to describe broad personality traits. The five factors are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism —- the acronym OCEAN is used to refer to all 5 traits. Within the OCEAN traits, each global factor (i.e., O, C, E, A, and N) is also associated with other personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion is associated with assertiveness). The current dataset contains 19719 survey responses to 50 questions relating to the OCEAN traits (10 per trait) as well as demographic info (i.e., race, age, gender, native language, and handedness). The survey was scored using a 5-point scale with response options 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree. The data was collected through an interactive online personality test.
