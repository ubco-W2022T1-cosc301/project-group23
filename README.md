# Group 23 - Analyizing the Five Factor Personality Test

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**


Our interests in the data relate to associations between the broad traits (i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) as well as inter-item correlations and relations between demographic information and personality traits. We are interested in how personality traits, individual items, and demographic information are related and can be used to predict outcomes. For instance, are extraversion and openness positively correlated? Is gender a predictor of personality traits? Additionally, we will combine the individual items in the dataset to create a ‘total’ score for each individual on each trait. In general, we are interested in psychology and personality theory and are hoping to reveal relationships among the variables in the dataset as well as our created ‘total’ variables. Some potential avenues for our research include: comparing the associations among the broad traits, comparing associations between broad traits and their constituent items, associations between scores on the broad traits and demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race). 



## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

**Please remember to update this section**

Our dataset consists of responses to the 5-factor personality test (AKA Big 5 personality test). The 5-Factor Personality test was developed in the 1980s after factor analysis revealed certain words/phrases used to describe personality tend to 'hang together' (i.e., there are 5 personality factors) and can be grouped to describe broad personality traits. The five factors are: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism —- the acronym OCEAN is used to refer to all 5 traits. Within the OCEAN traits, each global factor (i.e., O, C, E, A, and N) is also associated with other personality characteristics (e.g., extraversion is associated with assertiveness). The current dataset contains 19719 survey responses to 50 questions relating to the OCEAN traits (10 per trait) as well as demographic info (i.e., race, age, gender, native language, and handedness). The survey was scored using a 5-point scale with response options 1=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Agree. The data was collected through an interactive online personality test.

Notes from the Task 2 section of Milestone 2:

    1. Describe your dataset in 150-200 words  

Consider the following questions to guide you in your exploration:

    -Who: Which company/agency/organization provided this data?
    -What: What is in your data?
    -When: When was your data collected (for example, for which years)?
    Why: What is the purpose of your dataset? Is it for transparency/accountability, public interest, fun, learning, etc...
    -How: How was your data collected? Was it a human collecting the data? Historical records digitized? Server logs?

Additional Guidance: Your audience is fellow data scientists. You probably will not need more than 150 words to describe your dataset. All the questions above do not need to be answered, it’s more to guide your exploration and think a little bit about the context of your data. It is also possible you will not know the answers to some of the questions above, that is FINE - data scientists are often faced with the challenge of analyzing data from unknown sources. Do your best, acknowledge the limitations of your data as well as your understanding of it. Also, make it clear what you’re speculating about. For example, “I speculate that the {…column_name…} column must be related to {….} because {….}.”

    2. Describe your topic/interest in this dataset - answer in about 150-200 words

Some questions you may wish to consider:

    -What do you hope to do with your analytics project?
    -Why are you interested in this topic or dataset?
    -Do you have any questions you specifically want to explore?
    -Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?
        -Note: In the final weeks of the course you will be building a Dashboard with your data so choose wisely!
