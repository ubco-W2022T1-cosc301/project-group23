Notes from the Task 2 section of Milestone 2:

    1. Describe your data set in about 150-200 words

Consider the following questions to guid you in your expolartion:

    -Who: Which company/agency/organization provided this data?
    -What: What is in your data?
    -When: When was your data collected (for example, for which years)?
    Why: What is the purpose of your dataset? Is it for transparency/accountability, public interest, fun, learning, etc...
    -How: How was your data collected? Was it a human collecting the data? Historical records digitized? Server logs?

Additional Guidance: Your audience is fellow data scientists. You probably will not need more than 150 words to describe your dataset. All the questions above do not need to be answered, it’s more to guide your exploration and think a little bit about the context of your data. It is also possible you will not know the answers to some of the questions above, that is FINE - data scientists are often faced with the challenge of analyzing data from unknown sources. Do your best, acknowledge the limitations of your data as well as your understanding of it. Also, make it clear what you’re speculating about. For example, “I speculate that the {…column_name…} column must be related to {….} because {….}.”

    2. Describe your topic/interest in this dataset - answer in about 150-200 words

Some questions you may wish to consider:

    -What do you hope to do with your analytics project?
    -Why are you interested in this topic or dataset?
    -Do you have any questions you specifically want to explore?
    -Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?
        -Note: In the final weeks of the course you will be building a Dashboard with your data so choose wisely!
