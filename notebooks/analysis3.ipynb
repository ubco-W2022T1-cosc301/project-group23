    "My research question asks: Is there a relationship between personality traits and race?\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous research shows the relationship between personality traits among various cultures and ethnicity. Cultures and ethnicity influence socialization patterns, which shape some of the variances of personality (Triandis & Suh, 2002). However, limited research investigates the relationship between personality traits and race. Therefore, I would like to investigate the relationship between personality traits and race. I hypothesize that a particular race group would show higher scores on the big five personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness) than other race groups."
