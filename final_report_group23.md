# EDA

### During the exploratory data analysis of this project, the data was manipulated in different ways for each question because it was important for the data to reflect what was being looked at. However, there were a few main steps that were common among each. For starters, each member looked at the size of the overall data as well as what was included in this data, including the column names, data types, and stats of each type of data included. While looking at this it was found that there were some unanswered questions throughout the data, such as a zero for the race or gender data, or a very large number for the age data. This data was removed before the team members removed the columns they would not be needing for their questions. Once the data had been cleaned and unusable data had been filtered out each member created graphs from their data to try to get a sense of how to answer their questions. While looking at differences in ages vs personality traits this is one of the graphs created. Insert a graph here. Looking into the difference between males and females regarding personality traits, this graph was used as a starting point. Insert graph here. And the final question about differences in race and personality traits leads to graphs like this one. Insert graph here.

# Question 1 - How do the 5 different personality factors change over different age groups?

# Question 2 - How do scores between males and females differ on the 5 personality factors?


# Question 3

# Conclusion
